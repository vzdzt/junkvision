## ORIGINAL PROJECT DOCUMENTS (Foundation Roadmap)

[Insert full roadmap content here for continuity... See conversations for complete version]

---

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

✅ **Foundation Week (Nov 17, 2025)**
- Basic Expo React Native + TypeScript project initialized
- Hello World app structure present
- Development server operational (web version running)
- Git repository initialized locally & on GitHub (https://github.com/vzdzt/junkvision)
- React Navigation dependencies configured
- Project ready for AI integration phase

---

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Tech Stack (Week 1 Foundation)
**Frontend:**
- React Native + Expo (SDK 54)
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Navigation (configured, ready for routing)

**Backend Services:**
- Planned: Supabase/Firebase for data sync
- Planned: Google ML Kit for AI vision

**AI Components:**
- Google ML Kit library (for object detection, labeling)
- Real-time camera integration
- Computer vision pipeline for junk analysis

## DECISION LOG

### Architecture Decisions
| Date | Component | Decision | Rationale |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Nov 17 | Framework | Expo React Native + TypeScript | Future-proof, cross-platform, strong tooling |
| Nov 17 | Navigation | React Navigation | Industry standard for RN, wide adoption |
| Nov 17 | AI Vision | Google ML Kit | Cost-effective (free tier), accurate, web APIs |
| Nov 17 | Storage | Planned Supabase/Firebase | Real-time sync, auth ready |

### Technical Decisions
- Use functional components with hooks
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Expo managed workflow for simplicity

---

## TEAM WORKFLOW

### Development Environment
- macOS system
- VS Code IDE
- Node.js + npm for package management
- Git for version control
- GitHub for collaboration

### Communication
- This document serves as central knowledge base
- All decisions and changes logged here
- Weekly milestone check-ins

---

## NEXT STEPS IMMEDIATE TASKS

1. **Implement Camera Module** 📸
   - Permissions request
   - Camera component for photo capture
   - Integration with app navigation

2. **Setup Google ML Kit** 🤖
   - API configuration
   - Object detection pipeline
   - Test with sample images

3. **UI Wireframes** 🎨
   - Camera interface design
   - Results display screens
   - Navigation flow

## BUSINESS METRICS TRACKING (Future)

### Development KPIs
- Code commits per week
- Feature completion rate
- Bug resolution time

### Product KPIs
- App launch success (iOS/Android/Web)
- Camera accuracy percentage
- Estimation time (target: <30 seconds)

---

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Technical Risks
- **AI Accuracy:** Mitigated by ML model fine-tuning and fallback manual entry
- **Camera Permissions:** Clearly communicate in app store descriptions
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Test on multiple devices during development

### Timeline Risks
- Xcode installation delays: Use web version for development
- API setup complexity: Modular approach, test incrementally
